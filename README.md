# Find Your Hat

Find Your Hat is an interactive terminal-based game where the player navigates through a randomly generated field to retrieve their lost hat (`^`). Along the way, you must avoid falling into holes (`O`) or stepping out of bounds.

## Features

- **Randomized Field Generation**: The field is generated with a customizable size and percentage of holes.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Move up, down, left, or right to navigate the field.
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: Win by reaching your hat, but lose if you fall into a hole or move out of bounds.
